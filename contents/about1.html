     this existing gap of women in tech. Through techno-socio initiatives, the scheme aims to equip women to
      face their future confidently in this rapidly changing landscape. </span></p>
  <p class="w3-xlarge w3-wide">The program has been planned in 
      segments and the first phase of the SHE program has focused on training and mentoring of 50 selected
       female students. These fifty students are perceived to
     act as “Peer Leaders” who will propagate and partake in providing training to the remaining girls of GCEK.</p>

  <p class="w3-xxlarge">The 'SHE Coders' platform was initiated shortly thereafter, which provided an online platform for students to develop their coding skills with alumnae as mentors. The program provided flexible timing for conducting 
         activities which were designed in such a way so as to familiarize students with industry trends.<hr>
         <h2>Mode of operation</h2>
The coordinators of SHE program have well identified the value of our resourceful alumni and have ensured their fruitful participation in gathering suggestions and information. The other promising contributors to the program are the teaching fraternity of GCEK , resource persons from external agencies and experts from different walks of life. The SHE program also seeks all the support from PTA and the HRD Cell of GCEK
