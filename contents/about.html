<p>‘Scheme for Her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)’ was introduced by the HR cell of GCEK to bridge
     this existing gap of women in tech. Through techno-socio initiatives, the scheme aims to equip women to
      face their future confidently in this rapidly changing landscape. The program has been planned in 
      segments and the first phase of the SHE program has focused on training and mentoring of 50 selected
       female students. These fifty students are perceived to
     act as “Peer Leaders” who will propagate and partake in providing training to the remaining girls of GCEK.</p>
     <p>The 'SHE Coders' platform was initiated shortly thereafter, which provided an online platform for students to develop their coding skills with alumnae as mentors. The program provided flexible timing for conducting 
         activities which were designed in such a way so as to familiarize students with industry trends.</p>
